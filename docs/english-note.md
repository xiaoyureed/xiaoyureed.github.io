Could you speak a little bit slower? 极端情况下如果一个关键词也没听懂, 干脆直说 -- 让他慢点再说一遍

### 2.1. 入职后的 onboarding 邮件

```
Anastasia
Hey everyone,
I'm Anastasia or simply Ana 👋 a UX Designer & Researcher based in Germany
Before joining EA I worked at T-Systems, which is part of Deutsche Telekom - a telco company.
During my time there I worked on a B2B data marketplace, making sure a complex product is easy to use for users with varying data science know-how & a digital service assistant for different touchpoints, such as a smart speaker, helping teams understand user needs and working on (predictive) use cases.
In my free time you'll find me either cooking something plant-based, in the gym or getting lost in movies, tv-shows & books 🤓 (love all things Marvel, Lost, GoT, Dexter, Westworld...)
When I play video-games it's on a pc, single-player & preferably adventure/stealth 🐱‍👤
I'm really thrilled to be here & can't wait to get to know & work with you all on exciting projects!!
 
Kevin
Joining us from Slightlymad Studios is Kevin Boland, he is a hands-on Technical Director with 20 years of industry experience which all began in EA Chertsey.
When described as hands-on what this means is Kevin has worked on and written several proprietary Game and Rendering engines. Starting in EA working on Renderware to creating the engine for Chinatown Wars , the AGE (now RAGE) engine for Rockstar and finally the Madness engine used for Need for Speed Shift and Project Cars in SMS.
He has worked on and lead development on games that have been part of some top franchises. Some examples being Project Cars, GTA, Need for Speed and Harry Potter.
"Through the technology I help make we can empower people to create, to innovate and ultimately bring joy.
As a father of a neurodiverse child I see the positive impact the games and experiences we create has and how they help her manage the world"
Outside of work Kevin is a father to 3 girls who keep him very active. He enjoys all sports, however these days more watching than participating.
```


## 3. integral part 不可或缺的部分

```
Canonical example 经典示例
integral part 不可或缺的部分
in this scenario 在这个方案中
by nature 天生地, 本质上
create afresh 重新创建
Not even close 差得远
dummy data 虚假数据


have a severe impact on throughput 对吞吐量有严重影响

look for ... to do ... 借助...来做...

do ... to indicate that 通过做... 来指明...
    we can annotated the class with xxx to indicate that ...

If this is set to true, then no scanning of annotations takes place 如果将其设置为true，则不会扫描注释。

Such entries are referred to as "stale entries" 这些条目被称为“陈旧条目”


- Let’s say that we have an enormous resource that is I/O intense taking a long time to load blocking the executing thread for a substantial amount of time. It is better if that thread can be liberated to handle other requests in the meantime, instead of waiting for some I/O resource. 假设我们有一个巨大的资源，I / O强烈需要花费很长时间来加载阻塞执行线程很长一段时间。 最好是在此期间可以释放该线程来处理其他请求，而不是等待某些I / O资源

  - enormous 巨大的

  - substantial 大量的

  - intense 强烈的

  - a substantial amount of time 很长时间

  - can be liberated 被释放

  - Iphone that is money spending intense making a substantial amount of people crazy emptying their wallet

- This code will not block the executing thread but will perform the I/O operation in separate thread returning the result when ready using the AsyncContext.complete() method 此代码不会阻止正在执行的线程，但会在单独的线程中执行I / O操作，在使用AsyncContext.complete（）方法准备好时返回结果

- This may be very time-consuming if you have many jars in the classpath

- This class provides thread-local variables. These variables differ from their normal counterparts in that each thread that accesses one (via its get or set method) has its own, independently initialized copy of the variable 该类提供线程局部变量。这些变量与它们的正常counterparts的不同之处在于，访问一个变量的每个线程（通过其get或set方法）都有自己的，独立初始化的变量副本

  - differ from ... in that ...

  - counterparts 对应物

- Returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. 返回一个流，该流包含将给定函数应用于此流的元素的结果

- With the standard java sockets, if the server needed to be scalable, the socket had to be passed to another thread for processing so that the server could continue listening for additional connections, meaning call the ServerSocket’s accept() method again to listen for another connection.使用标准的Java套接字，如果服务器需要可伸缩，则必须将套接字传递给另一个线程进行处理，以便服务器可以继续侦听其他连接，这意味着再次调用ServerSocket的accept（）方法来侦听另一个连接。

- The Remote interface serves to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked from a non-local virtual machineRemote接口用于标识可以从非本地虚拟机调用其方法的接口

```


## 4. 听力练习

### 4.1. 方法论

```
第一步：用qq影音打开一个视频，alt+鼠标左键选择遮挡字幕区域（用书挡也行。。。）

第二步：放一句，听写一句

一遍没听出来，可以再听3-5遍，不要逐个逐个单词去听

第三步：听完十句话左右，去掉遮挡字幕（alt+双击屏幕），对照文本，修改，动手查不认识的单词or词组

图二：

第四步：分析没听出来的原因

问题一：单词不认识？

问题二：语音现象，比如连读，弱读未听出来？

第五步：

问题一解决方法：查生词，英文解释，记录在一个固定的本子or文档，最好自己仿照例句再造两个句子

问题二解决方法：跟读

过程：

1.放一句视频，看着字幕跟着读3遍，一句一句过完今天听的内容；

2.放一段视频，中间不暂停，看着字幕跟着读，重复3遍；

3.放一段视频，中间不暂停，落后原视频2秒的速度，开始不看字幕跟着读，一遍跟不上，可以重复，直到几乎跟读出来为止；

结束！听的长度可根据每天自身情况调整，但每天至少听1分钟！ 坚持21天以上
```
